// Items are one-use objects carried through a run. Each item lives in the
// player's pocket until it's used; using it consumes it. The action menu
// surfaces only items whose `when(patient, player)` predicate is true
// (verbs whose when is missing are always usable).
//
// Some items help. Some hurt. Some do both. The player picks one at
// admission and gains more from corridor events and resolutions.
//
// Item shape:
//   id, name, file (short prose), desc (mechanical), voice (line spoken at pickup)
//   when?(patient, player): bool
//   respond(patient, player): Response   — same shape as a verb response
//
// Items can read patient.def.scales to behave differently across patients.
// They can author composureCost on negative composure, just like verbs.
