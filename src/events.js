// Corridor events — short vignettes between patient encounters. Each
// event presents a scene and 2–3 choices. Each choice carries an
// `effect(player, run)` that mutates the player (composure, scars, items).
//
// Items are the primary reward: most "good" choices hand the player an
// item from the CORRIDOR pool, sometimes alongside a small composure
// boost. Some "good" choices have a hidden cost — a scar, a worse item,
// or a composure ding later.
