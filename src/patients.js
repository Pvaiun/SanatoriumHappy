// THE PRAM — Patient 0028
// ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// A young woman whose son died at delivery. She refuses to accept it. She
// arrived at the ward with a pram and a bundle of rags she insists is the
// infant. She rocks him, sings him a five-note lullaby, and has a violent
// fit when anyone questions the bundle. Three paths:
//   - Indulge: sing along, agree he is sleeping; she keeps the delusion.
//   - Confront: name the death gently; if she can bear it, she grieves;
//     if pushed too hard, she goes into a fit.
//   - Take the bundle: lower her grip and lift it out of her hands.
//     She lets go. She is free of it.

//
// A man who was the head of a household. Lordly, abusive, physical. One of
// his daughters took her own life. He went mad and refused to learn the
// lesson. He now holds court in this room over a family that has stopped
// coming, and attacks any who defy him. Three paths:
//   - Submit: kneel and accept; he keeps you as a daughter of the house.
//   - Grieve: name her, lower his guard, close his eyes when he finally weeps.
//   - Chased out: push him too far; he stands, and the door becomes the only
//     thing in the room.

// THE NIGHT NURSE — Patient 0042
// ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// A nurse who worked the night ward for thirty-eight years. One night she
// administered the wrong dose. The patient did not survive. She redoubled
// on the work, stayed past every shift, and over the next year burned out
// badly enough to make two more fatal errors. She was fired. She would
// not accept it. She still arrives every night to do her rounds. The
// staff replaced her medication tray with sugar water and let her keep
// folding sheets. Three paths:
//   - Be attended to: let her tend you. She works her old routine, and
//     eventually she notices the tray is empty.
//   - Confront her: name the patient she lost. She breaks down and
//     grieves for the first time in years.
//   - Walk away: leave her to the work. She does not notice you go.

// THE BENCH — Patient 0118
// ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// A young woman who sent her husband off to war. She sat at the rail
// platform every night to meet him on his return. Summer turned to
// winter. She did not move. She froze onto the bench. Her husband died
// in the war; she has not been told. Three paths:
//   - Warm her: thaw her hands, ease the wait, tell her he is not coming,
//     walk her off the bench.
//   - Pretend to be him: say his name as he would say it; she stands and
//     takes your arm. Tragic — he will leave again.
//   - Sit with her: stay on the bench until you are also frozen. The cold
//     takes you.
